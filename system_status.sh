echo "=== ROS2 Camera Rectangle Detection System ==="
echo "âœ… Successfully resolved the executable detection issue!"
echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ WORKING SOLUTIONS:"
echo ""
echo "1. Direct Python execution:"
echo "   Terminal 1: python3 build/camera_mocap_launcher/camera_mocap_launcher/camera_node.py"
echo "   Terminal 2: python3 build/camera_mocap_launcher/camera_mocap_launcher/rectangle_detector.py"
echo ""
echo "2. ROS2 Launch file (WORKING!):"
echo "   ros2 launch camera_mocap_launcher camera_rectangle_launch.py"
echo ""
echo "3. Alternative Python-based launch:"
echo "   ros2 launch camera_mocap_launcher camera_rectangle_python_launch.py"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ“‹ SYSTEM FEATURES:"
echo "- Camera Node: Publishes processed video on /camera/processed_image"
echo "- Rectangle Detector: Subscribes to camera feed and detects ArUco markers with ID > 10"
echo "- Pairs consecutive IDs (11-12, 13-14, etc.) as diagonal corners of rectangles"
echo "- Provides rectangle information: center, dimensions, area, diagonal length"
echo "- Real-time visual feedback with drawn rectangles and markers"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL NOTES:"
echo "- Fixed setup.py with proper entry_points configuration"
echo "- Resolved NumPy compatibility issues (downgraded to numpy<2)"
echo "- Converted from CMake to pure Python package (ament_python)"
echo "- Implemented ROS2 topic communication between nodes"
echo "- Created working launch files using ExecuteProcess for direct executable paths"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ“Š Current ROS2 Topics:"
ros2 topic list | grep -E "(camera|image)" | head -5

echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ To test the system:"
echo "1. Place ArUco markers with IDs > 10 in the camera view"
echo "2. Consecutive pairs (like 11-12, 13-14) will be detected as rectangle corners"
echo "3. Watch the output for rectangle detection information"
echo "4. Visual feedback will show in both camera windows"
